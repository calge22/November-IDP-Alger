# November IDP Reflection

For my last IDP I made a version of the simple game 'rock, paper, scissors.' The way I made it mostly used conditionals and text display. For this month's IDP I wanted to try a different game that would give me more practice with some other functions. I decided to make Tic Tac Toe, and I did use the help of a Coding Train tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTWrWM1UsnA. 

Making this game gave me a lot of practice with making shapes and understanding the coordinate plane of the canvas, "for loops", and arrays. 

The first challenge was figuring out how to display the Xs and Os. While starting off just using text, I realized it would look better and make more sense to use shapes. The tutorial helped me place the Xs in the center of each box on the board by assigning a variable to the value of 1/3 the width of each box and adding or subtracting that value as necessary from the X's coordinates to place it in the center of the box.

Another challenge was making sure that during each turn, an X or an O would be placed in an empty spot. This problem was solved with the nextTurn function (notes included in code).

At this point, this Tic Tac Toe game code will only make alternating plays - I have yet to make it find/define a win or loss. Hopefully I can explore that problem in my next IDP, or take what I learned from project and apply it to something new.
